We were told the individual mandate wasn't a tax. None of these were true. #Obamacare
"Americans were told that if they liked their plans and doctors, they could keep them. #Obamacare"

"Despite the Obama Admin's habit of moving the goal posts, #ObamaCare is not delivering the results Americans were originally promised."
"Under #Obamacare, Americans have experienced broken exchanges, cancelled coverage, higher premiums, and unaffordable deductibles."
"The prospect of lower enrollment figures should come as no surprise, given #Obamacare's troubled track record over the last year."
"Once again, #HHS is lowering expectations ahead of #Obamacare's open enrollment period, a tactic now par for the course for the Obama Admin."
So let's talk about #Obamacare enrollment estimates.

"Instead of bowing to POTUS political pressure, #FCC should take into account strong bipartisan support for keeping the internet free & open."
"A free and open internet allows Americans to operate small businesses, communicate freely, & stay competitive in a changing global economy."
The internet's revolutionary success is due in large part to an entrepreneurialism that adapts and innovates freely as the internet evolves.
#FCC internet regulation would stifle economic growth and open the pathway for unnecessary government interference. #netneutrality
President Obama's decision to put political pressure on the #FCC to regulate the internet is bad for American consumers. #netneutrality

Proponents of #Obamacare cannot cover up their regrets by ignoring the plain text of the law when it proves inconvenient.
The statute provides no authority for subsidies through the federal exchange. #Obamacare
The sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created #Obamacare is rightly catching up to it.
Adequate analysis was never conducted of the government's authority to provide premium subsidies through exchanges established by fed gov't.
#Obamacare was pushed on the American people through a highly partisan effort.

@jdrch House of Representatives voted in June of 2012 to hold AG Holder in criminal contempt.
"The doc production may contain sensitive information, so our investigative staff will be carefully examining them. #FastandFurious"
"This doc production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch, for transparence, and for efforts to check Executive Branch power."
I am deeply concerned that some redactions to these #FastandFurious docs may still be inappropriate and contrary to judge's order.
"Because of this, our court case will continue. #FastandFurious"
These pages still do not represent the entire universe of the docs the House is seeking related to the botched #FastandFurious scandal.
"Judge's order compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and Pres. Obama illegally withheld from Congress. #FastandFurious"
"When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge's order."
Approximately two-thirds of the universe of focus that #DOJ withheld from Congress has now been shown to be outside scope of Exec Privilege.
"In effect, last night's doc production is an admission that #DOJ never had legitimate grounds to withhold them. #FastandFurious"
Sheer volume of last night's doc production show POTUS & Atty Gen attempted to extend scope of Exec Privilege beyond historical boundaries.

This placed public safety at risk on both sides of the border by allowing the trafficking of grenades to narco-terrorists.
Failure of the AZ U.S. Attorney's Office to take action allowed a dangerous individual to remain free and continue his criminal activities.
