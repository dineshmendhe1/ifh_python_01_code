# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Python 
We are using TextBlob library for sentiment analysis. It tells us the sentiment of a sentence based on a dictionary of words which tag words
as negative and positive and give them a score ranging from -1 to 1 based on polarity. Sentences are first divided into bag of workds/tokens,
then sentiment value of each word is calculated suing sentiment lexicon. The subjectivity value tells us whether a sentense is opinionated or factual.
